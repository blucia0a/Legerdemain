A library for instrumenting programs and replacing/wrapping functions.  This
project is a convenience wrapper for the LD_PRELOAD trick.  To use LDM plugins
(like scaley_LDM.so), you need to LD_PRELOAD libldm.so and scaley_LDM.so by
setting LD_PRELOAD=<path>/libldm.so:<path>/scaley_LDM.so in your environment.

libldm.so does/will implement management and instrumentation

scaley_LDM.so shows how to use LDM's macros to replace a function call (read, in this example) with your version.  It shows how to call the original as well.

TODO:
*Add support for generic instrumentation (non function call based)
*Add support for plugins to stream tasks to LDM data aggregation thread
